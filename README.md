# PySQL_sandbox
Just having some fun with Python and MySQL making user-input type programs to creating databases, tables, and adding or editing data within them.
The next steps I have are: data entry, edits, and group edits using Python commands and algorithms.
The final purpose of this project will be to have a program with loops to allow users to do anything I've listed in one singular program file with error-catching.
